                    <h2>1. Use a reusable bottle/cup for beverages on-the-go</h2>
                    <p class>You might already have a reusable water bottle, but do you use it all the time? You
                        can put that reusable bottle to use, save money and reduce waste. By taking your own water with
                        you, you’ll also reduce your chances of purchasing more expensive beverages on-the-go. This will
                        eliminate the one-time use containers they come in. While most cans and bottles can be recycled,
                        they require a lot of energy to be produced, shipped to the bottling facility and then to the
                        store for purchase.</p>
                    <h2>2. Use reusable grocery bags, and not just for groceries</h2>
                    <p class>Just like a reusable water bottle, you may already have a reusable grocery bag, though it’s
                        often forgotten at home. Try writing BAGS on the top of your grocery list to help you remember,
                        or keep them in the back seat where they aren’t as easy to forget. Many grocery stores will
                        provide a 5 cent per bag refund so you’ll save a few cents while reducing your usage of
                        one-time-use plastic bags.</p>
                    <h2>3. Purchase wisely and recycle</h2>
                    <p class>By choosing items with less packaging or packaging that can be recycled, you can cut down
                        on the amount of waste you generate. Before making a purchase, read the labels to make sure the
                        plastic is recyclable in Delaware.</p>
                    <h2>4. Compost it! </h2>
                    <p class>Did you know that up to 25% of the things in your garbage might potentially be composted in
                        your backyard instead of entering the waste stream? You may compost your egg shells, coffee
                        grounds, grass clippings, leaves, and leftover fruit and vegetable scraps. Composting will
                        provide you a positive return on your time and effort investment, even if it needs more work
                        than the lifestyle improvements discussed before. You could have compost to utilize in your
                        garden in 3 to 12 months, depending on the circumstances. If you cultivate your own veggies,
                        you'll save money on fertilizers and probably receive better harvests.
                    </p>
                    <h2>5. Avoid single-use food and drink containers and utensils </h2>
                    <p class>JAvoid using single-use coffee cups, disposable cutlery, straws, and napkins whenever you
                        can. Some establishments will even reduce the price of your coffee if you bring your own mug.
                        Keep a set of cutlery, a plate, a bowl, and a reusable cup at your place of employment. Avoid
                        using plastic straws completely or invest in reusable metal ones. Keep in mind that many of
                        these goods are made of plastic, have to be brought by truck, and, once we have used them once,
                        will be disposed of in a landfill. Anything we can do to cut back on our consumption of these
                        goods will have a significant impact.

                                        Recycling helps the environment be less disturbed. Animal damage is avoided when
                                        we clear fewer trees and forests. We contribute to the preservation of
                                        ecosystems and species by minimizing interruption and damage to the natural
                                        environment.

                                        Recycling aids in the conservation of some of the natural resources that the
                                        world is running low on.
                                        Paper recycling helps preserve forests and plants. Plastic may take hundreds of
                                        years to decompose and requires a lot of solid waste when it is recycled.
                                        Additionally, the majority of plastic is made from hydrocarbons found in fossil
                                        fuels.
                                        Metal recycling decreases the need to mine new metal ores, while glass recycling
                                        decreases our demand for some raw resources, such as sand.

                                        Utilizing recycled materials instead of fresh, raw resources saves energy during
                                        production. Making things using recycled materials instead of virgin materials
                                        requires a lot less energy. One glass bottle recycled, for instance, may save
                                        enough energy to run a 100-watt light bulb for four hours.

                                        Recycling lessens the requirement for raw material harvesting. People who live

                                        Recycling trash is far less expensive than standard garbage collection and
                                        disposal. More money may be saved by recycling more. Returns on deposits might
                                        assist provide additional financial motivation to recycle.
                                        Recycling may contribute to environmental protection and resource conservation.
                                        Recycling is essential, as is reducing the quantity of trash we release into the
                                        environment. By doing this, we can conserve energy, lessen landfill waste, and
                                        safeguard the environment.
